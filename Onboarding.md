## Welcome to the Team! Getting Started Guidelines for New Members

We're thrilled to have you with us! To help you settle in smoothly, here are some handy tips and information.

### 1. Arriving in the U.S. (for International Employees)
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li><strong>I94 Form</strong>: If you're joining us from abroad, you'll need to download your I94 form. You can find it here: <a href="https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/recent-search">I94</a>.</li>
<li><strong>International Orientation</strong>: Don't forget to schedule your International Orientation and Registration using <a href="https://visamanager.partners.org/istart/controllers/start/StartEngine.cfm?serviceid=LimitedServicesLogonProvider">this link</a>.</li>
</ul>

### 2. Social Security Number (SSN) (if applicable)
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li>If you don't have an SSN yet, you can register at <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security</a>.</li>
<li>The Social Security office close to us is at 10 Causeway St, Boston, MA 02222. We recommend arriving 15–30 minutes before opening time to get everything done quickly! While booking an appointment online is an option, the wait can be 2-3 weeks, so visiting in person is usually faster.</li>
</ul>

### 3. Registering Your Email
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li>Set up your email account at <a href="https://myprofile.partners.org/Public/NewRegister">My Profile Partners</a>. You'll need a valid phone number to register.</li>

### 4. Microsoft Teams & Lab Communications
<ul class="no-bullets">

</ul>

### 5. Getting Your MGH Photo ID Badge
<ul class="no-bullets">

<li><strong>Location</strong>: Wang Building, Room 232, 15 Parkman St, Boston, MA 02114.</li>
<li><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: If possible, try to do this the day before your start date. It'll make your first day smoother!</li>
</ul>

### 6. Occupational Health Check
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li>Book your health check appointment at the MGH Occupational Health Service, located at 165 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114. It's often quicker to visit in person since phone lines can be busy.</li>
